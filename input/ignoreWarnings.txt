%This SNOMED-CT based include has some concepts with semantic tags (FSN terms) and some without (preferred terms)%
%The IG is not for the international realm, and it uses SNOMED CT, so it should fix the SCT edition in the expansion parameters%

The URL should refer directly to the ImplementationGuide resource (e.g. include '/ImplementationGuide/')
