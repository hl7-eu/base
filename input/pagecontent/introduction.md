This version of the guide includes European base and core profiles, as well as other artefacts, such as profiles describing the European Health Insurance Card, which are candidates for reuse by HL7 Europe or HL7 EU-derived guides.


### Definitions:

- **Base profiles.** A set of profiles designed to specify how commonly used concepts in Europe are represented in HL7 FHIR. These profiles are loosely constrained and serve as the foundation for any European-derived profiles.
- **Core profiles.** A more constrained set of profiles intended for reuse in the majority of EU REALM HL7 FHIR IGs. When reasonable and applicable, alignment with IPS profiles is pursued.

### EHDS compatibility

The profiles are loosely based on eHealth Network guidelines. However, the description of these data sets varies across different guidelines, and the profiles aim to capture only the focus concepts of the data sets.
