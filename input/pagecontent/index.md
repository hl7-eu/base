### Scope


This Implementation Guide (IG) brings together **base** and **core** HL7® FHIR® artifacts designed specifically for the European context.

It provides a foundation for interoperability, ensuring reusability across national projects, European initiatives, and derived HL7 Europe guides.

The guide supports:

* Developers and implementers who need common building blocks.

* Policymakers and program leads who require consistent definitions for EHDS-aligned projects.

* Standards experts who wish to build on a harmonized European foundation.

### Introduction

The HL7 Europe Base and Core Implementation Guide provides a **layered approach to FHIR interoperability** in the European context; and it aims to support a coherent and reusable set of FHIR specifications across Europe. 

It includes:

- **Base profiles.**  Loosely constrained baseline definitions of common European concepts (e.g., Patient, Practitioner). They provide flexibility and serve as the foundation for Core and derived profiles.

- **Core profiles.**  More constrained profiles designed for reuse across most European IGs. They introduce essential constraints, can often be used directly, and pursue alignment with IPS.

See the [**Introduction** page](introduction.html) for detailed explanations of Base and Core profiles, their relationship with Extensions and scoped IGs, and their alignment with EHDS and IPS.

### Guide Publication

This guide is published for two HL7 FHIR versions:

- **HL7 FHIR R4 Base IG** (hl7.fhir.eu.base). This Guide.
- **HL7 FHIR R5 Base IG** (hl7.fhir.eu.base-r5). Published at [this link](https://hl7.eu/fhir/base-r5).


Both versions are maintained by HL7 Europe and evolve based on community feedback and EHDS requirements.
