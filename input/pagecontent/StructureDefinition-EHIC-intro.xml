	<h3>European Health Insurance Card</h3>
	<a> </a>
	<p>The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) is a free card that gives you access to medically necessary, state-provided healthcare during a temporary stay in any of the 27 EU countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, under the same conditions and at the same cost (free in some countries) as people insured in that country.</p>
	<h4>How to recognise the card</h4>
	<a> </a>
	<p>The cards can be easily recognised. The front of the card looks the same and carries the same information, although in different languages, in each country. The back of the card can vary from country to country. You can click on a country in the  <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=653&amp;langId=en">How to recognise the card </a> page to see what it looks like in that country.</p>
