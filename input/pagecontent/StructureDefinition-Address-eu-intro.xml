	<h3>Address extensions</h3>
	<a> </a>
	<p>The Address extensions provide additional information about a patient's address, as the fact that it is an official address, or more structured information about the address itself.</p>
	<p>This profile doesn't explicitly list all of them, but only those that are explicitly listed in the EHDS Address model. Examples of extensions not included, but used in several jurisdictions are:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-ADXP-buildingNumberSuffix">ADXPBuildingNumberSuffix</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-ADXP-additionalLocator">ADXPAdditionalLocator</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/iso21090-ADXP-unitID">ADXPUnitID</a></li>
	</ul>
	</p>	
	<p>Implementers should refer to the HL7 FHIR specification for guidance on the use of these extensions.</p>
	<p>Please note that the fact they are not included in the differential doesn't preclude their use in a compliant instance.</p>
