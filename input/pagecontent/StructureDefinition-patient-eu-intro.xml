	<h3>Sex and Gender extensions</h3>
	<a> </a>
	<h4>Sex Parameters for Clinical Use</h4>
	<a> </a>
	<p>Sex Parameters for Clinical Use (SPCU) may be used in specific clinical contexts. However, there are cases where having a context-free categorisation of a patient can be useful. When using SPCU at a patient level, consider if any information is available suggesting that the patient is NOT male-typical or female-typical across all clinical contexts, then using specified as the patient-level SPCU is most appropriate.</p>
<h4>Gender Identity</h4>
<a> </a>	
<p>This represents an individual’s identity, ascertained by asking them what that identity is. The standard extension supports multiple gender identities, with relevant periods to account for a patient’s gender identity changing over time.</p>
	<h4>Pronouns</h4>
	<a> </a>
	<p>The pronouns to use when referring to an individual in verbal or written communication.</p>
	<p>More details about these and other sex/gender related extensions can be found in the <a href="https://hl7.org/xprod/ig/uv/gender-harmony/">HL7 Cross Paradigm Implementation Guide: Gender Harmony - Sex and Gender Representation, Edition 1</a>.</p>
