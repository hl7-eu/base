1. The Xt-EHR logical models are under active revision and continuous refinement. Updates from the Xt-EHR project will be progressively incorporated into this Implementation Guide. This will ensure ongoing alignment with the evolving EHDS specifications.

2. No obligations are specified in this version, although they are relevant for the correct use of these profiles. Further clarification is in fact needed regarding the actors to be defined and the use case-specific obligations that should be defined in the scoped Implementation Guides (e.g., ePrescription), also based on the results of the Xt-EHR project.

3. In this version, mappings from logical models to HL7 FHIR profiles are provided as textual tables, adopting, where feasible, the mapping relationships defined for FHIR R6 ConceptMap. Future versions will use ConceptMap resources to formally represent these maps.
