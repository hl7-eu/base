This is the second preview release of the EHDS Logical Information Models developed under the Xt-EHR Joint Action. This is a release candidate version and may be subject to future refinement.

### Introduction

This implementation guide includes logical information models created in [Xt-EHR project](https://www.xt-ehr.eu/work-packages). These models are the basis for designing the EHDS data exchange format (EEHRxF).

### Specification

This guide includes EHDS models for all the priority categories, and many of the models are shared between use cases.

HL7 FHIR Implementation Guides for the EEHRxF are created in cooperation with other EU projects working on EHDS implementation (please find the links under specific use cases).

Logical Information Models IG should be used as a basis for all the use cases to make sure common data objects (patient, medication, etc) are modelled in a consistent way. Use case specific FHIR implementation guides shall include mappings to the models.

The principles of metada management, including information models, are described in [Xt-EHR Metadata IG](https://xt-ehr.github.io/xt-ehr-metadata/).

Content of the guide is based on many earlier works. Common sources for all use cases include:

* [eHealth Network guidelines](https://health.ec.europa.eu/ehealth-digital-health-and-care/eu-cooperation/ehealth-network_en#ehealth-network-guidelines) (including the results from eHN Subgroup of Semantics guideline consistency task force);
* [MyHealth@EU requirements catalogue](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/EHDSI/1.+MyHealth@EU+Requirements+Catalogue);
* [X-eHealth project](https://x-ehealth.min-saude.pt/);
* [XpanDH project](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7-eu/xpandh/).
