* **Discharge Report model**

## Logical Model: Discharge Report model 

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| *Official URL*:http://www.xt-ehr.eu/fhir/models/StructureDefinition/EHDSDischargeReport | *Version*:0.3.0 |
| Draft as of 2026-02-06 | *Computable Name*:EHDSDischargeReport |

 
A generic, flexible model for any kind of discharge report. Different types of encounters may require adding relevant sections and elements, or omitting irrelevant ones, depending on their data needs. 

**Usages:**

* This Logical Model is not used by any profiles in this Implementation Guide
