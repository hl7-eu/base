### Scope

This guide collects base and core profiles to be used in the European context. It also includes common artifacts, such as the profiles describing the European Health Insurance Card.

### Introduction

This version of the guide gathers various kinds of profiles and artefacts intended for reuse across HL7 Europe or derived guides.

It includes:

- **Base profiles** aim to specify how concepts commonly used in Europe are represented in HL7 FHIR. These profiles, loosely constrained, are intended to serve as the foundation for any European-derived profiles.
- **Core profiles**, a set of more constrained profiles, are intended to be reused in the majority of EU REALM HL7 FHIR IGs. When reasoneable and applicable, the alignment with IPS profiles is pursued.

Distinct HL7 FHIR Implementation Guides may be created in the future to document these types of profiles.
